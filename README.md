# Introduction to Python Programming
1. Python is a high-level, interpreted language easy-to-learn programming language used for building websites, software, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation. <br>
2. It is popular because of its simple and readable syntax, making it beginner-friendly. Python supports many libraries and frameworks, <br>
   which help developers quickly create powerful applications. <br>
3. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and web development.<br>

# Key Features of Python:
1. Its syntax looks like plain English, so beginners can learn it quickly. <br>
2. Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux without major changes.<br>
3. Has thousands of built-in and third-party libraries for tasks like data analysis (NumPy, Pandas), machine learning (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn), web development (Django, Flask), and visualization (Matplotlib,   Seaborn).

# How to install python ?
1. Visit the Python official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   # Note:
   *Add path before installing python into system.*

# Python interpreter
1. Python interpreter is a tool that helps to execute code line by line.
2. Python uses an interpreter (CPython by default) to read and run the program directly.
    
# Python REPL
1. Python REPL(Read Evaluate Print Loop) lets you run code line by line and see result instantly.<br>
    Read: Takes the command you type.<br>
    Eval: Evaluates (executes) the command.<br>
    Print: Shows the result/output.<br>
    Loop: Repeats the process for the next command.

# Extension
1. Use .py extension to save python file.
2. Use .ipynb extension to save jupyter notebook file.
